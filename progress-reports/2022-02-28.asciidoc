= Progress report 28. Feb. 2022

.What I've done
* Fixed bugs
* Shifted focus more towards writing
    ** creating assignments
    ** writing report
    ** writing book
* Decided to focus mainly on single core for the labs
    ** multicore presents difficult challenges such as TLB synchronisation
       This is likely way outside curriculum for a third semester OS course, so focusing on the important parts seems more prudent
* Some changes to system interface
    ** syscall number placed in `a0`
    ** No `SetPC` method on `cpu`, returning from trap instead sets `c.pc = c.csr[Csr_MEPC]`
        *** This mimics a real RISC-V system where `MRET` is used to return into user mode

.Goals for this week
* Flesh out report properly before first deliverable
* Not much else, have other deadlines coming up which demand focus

.Goals for the foreseeable future
* Complete assignments 1&2, simple processes
    ** Write adequate amount of tests for labs
* Complete first 4 chapters of the book (the processor, processes, simple scheduling)
