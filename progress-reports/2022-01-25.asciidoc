= Progress report 25. Jan. 2022

Looked at TLB implementation alternatives:

- It's gonna suck, big time.

Started explicitly defining system specifications

- Programs start executing at `0x4000`

- Paging will be the only supported method of memory virtualisation

Started looking at the possibilities of creating an ELF loader that returns a pcb which can be added to the scheduler queue.

Decided that segmentation is a dead end, only interesting as history and not in implementation.

Started adding framework for labs

- Processes and scheduling
    - The process control block (pcb)
    - Scheduling a process
    - Descheduling a process
    - The context switch
- Preemptive scheduling
    - Interrupt me! (timers/counters and interrupts)
        - Setting and enabling a counter
        - Handling an interrupt
