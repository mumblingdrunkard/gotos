== VOLUME I - Processes and Scheduling

.The good, the bad, and the process (process abstraction and scheduling)
* Loading your first program
* The batch scheduler (FIFO)
* Scheduling metrics
* Optimal scheduling (SJF)

.The shell (INTERLUDE)
* The run command
* Command line arguments

.It's all an illusion (preemptive scheduling, concurrent execution)
* Concurrent execution
* Interrupts
* New-job-arrived-interrupt
* Interrupt handler
* SJRF scheduling
* Timer interrupt for preemption
* Round-robin scheduling
* Stride scheduling

== VOLUME II - Virtual memory

.It's all an illusion II - Electric boogaloo (simple virtual memory)
* Base/bound virtual memory
* The mmu
* Translate and check
* Again!? (SIGSEGV) (INTERLUDE)
* Free space management
** Section header (linked list)

.More, more! I want more! (simple dynamic memory allocation) (INTERLUDE)
* Memory allocation
* Finding free space
* I don't want it anymore (free'ing space)

.What's mine is yours... SIKE! (memory sectioning and protection)
* Multiple base/bound pairs
* Permission flags
** Raising exceptions
* Handling the exception

.What? This isn't a book! (paging)
* Pages and frames

.What? This isn't the library! (multi-level page tables)
